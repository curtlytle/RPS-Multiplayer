"# RPS-Multiplayer" 

- Game designed to have only two people on different computers/browsers at once.
- It is not very mobile friendly, but that wasn't in the requirements.
- Best if used on computers, since browsers there work on when a user exits
    - the game unloads a player and resets when a player exits or reloads their browser
    - on mobile, this doesn't work - I guess the window.onunload is different on mobile
    - if I knew that I could easily incorporate that with mobile
